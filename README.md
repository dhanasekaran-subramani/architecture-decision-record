# Architecture decision record (ADR)

An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences. It is a way to document the rationale behind key decisions in a software project, ensuring that the reasoning is preserved for future reference. This helps in understanding why certain decisions were made, especially when revisiting the project after some time or when new team members join.

An ADR typically includes the following sections:

Title: A brief title for the decision.
Context: The background and reasons leading to the decision.
Decision: The actual decision that was made.
Consequences: The outcomes and implications of the decision, both positive and negative.

Here's a template for an ADR:

# ADR: [Title]

## Context
[Description of the context and background that led to the decision.]

## Decision
[The decision that was made.]

## Rationale
[Explanation of why this decision was made.]

## Alternatives Considered
- [Alternative 1 and why it was not chosen]
- [Alternative 2 and why it was not chosen]

## Consequences
- **Positive**: [Positive outcomes of the decision.]
- **Negative**: [Negative outcomes of the decision.]

## Related ADRs
- [Link to related ADR 1]
- [Link to related ADR 2]
  

ADRs help maintain a clear history of architectural decisions, making it easier to understand the evolution of a system's architecture.


# What are some best practices for writing effective ADRs?

1. **Be Concise and Clear:** Write in a clear and concise manner. Avoid jargon and overly complex language. The goal is to make the ADR understandable to anyone who reads it.

2. **Provide Context:** Clearly explain the context and background that led to the decision. This includes the problem being solved, the requirements, and any constraints.

3. **State the Decision Explicitly:** Clearly state the decision that was made. This should be a definitive statement that leaves no room for ambiguity.

4. **Explain the Rationale:** Provide the reasoning behind the decision. Explain why this decision was made over other alternatives.

5. **List Alternatives Considered:** Document other options that were considered and why they were not chosen. This helps in understanding the decision-making process.

6. **Describe the Consequences:** Outline the consequences of the decision, both positive and negative. This includes the impact on the system, team, and future development.

7. **Use a Consistent Format:** Use a consistent template for all ADRs. This makes it easier to read and understand multiple ADRs.

8. **Version Control:** Store ADRs in a version-controlled repository. This ensures that changes to decisions are tracked over time.

9. **Review and Update:** Regularly review and update ADRs as the project evolves. Decisions may need to be revisited and revised based on new information or changes in the project.

10. **Link to Related ADRs:** If there are related decisions, link to those ADRs. This helps in understanding the broader context and how decisions are interconnected.

An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences. It is a way to document the rationale behind key decisions in a software project, ensuring that the reasoning is preserved for future reference. This helps in understanding why certain decisions were made, especially when revisiting the project after some time or when new team members join.

An ADR typically includes the following sections:

Title: A brief title for the decision.
Context: The background and reasons leading to the decision.
Decision: The actual decision that was made.
Consequences: The outcomes and implications of the decision, both positive and negative.

Here's a template for an ADR:

# ADR: [Title]

## Context
[Description of the context and background that led to the decision.]

## Decision
[The decision that was made.]

## Consequences
- **Positive**: [Positive outcomes of the decision.]
- **Negative**: [Negative outcomes of the decision.]

ADRs help maintain a clear history of architectural decisions, making it easier to understand the evolution of a system's architecture.
